Our objective is to make an app which will help people find out which dog suits their environment. 
The user would take a personality test which would help us identify the kind of breed they are looking for, 
giving them necessary information about the dog type matched. 
In the dog-breed-selector test, various questions will be asked based on which dog breed would be suggested. 
Based on these questions suitable dog breeds are selected.
